Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.

RUBY  - ruby 1.8.6

Gems Required

Steps for setting up the application

1) rake db:create 
   rake db:migrate
   rake db:fixtures:load
  (for dropping/creating database, runing migrations and loading fixtures)

   or you can use rake db:bootstrap(custom method)
 
   Currently I have considered first 10 blocks.We can populate it through fixtures
   We can add more blocks through "Create Blocks" link in "Block Management" screen  

2) mongrel_rails :start or ruby script/server

3) http://localhost:3000/

4) "Create Blocks" and  "Create categories" links are provided to create blocks and categories which will be populated on block management screen.
    We can add or delete blocks and categories and it will be reflected in "Block Management" screen.
    So we can store more different types of documents and it allows relatively easy addition of new document types.

5) "Upload" link will bring popup where we can select and upload document based on the document type (as per the requirements)
   NOTE: Document size should be more than 2MB. We shouldn't be able to upload Asbestos Survey for blocks built before 1st Jan 2000.
   We can change the date in /config/settings.yml so it will be our default date

6) API Documentation for "block_management" is available at "/block_management/doc/app/index.html"
